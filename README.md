# Burninator

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/cjdev/burninator.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/cjdev/burninator)

Jira-driven burndowns.

#### Installation

Run `yarn install` in the root directory.

If the first time installing, create a `data` directory on the root directory.

#### Running the app locally

Concurrently, in separate consoles, run:

`yarn run server:dev` (hot reloads the server) or `yarn run server`

`yarn run client`

Navigate to http://localhost:3000 (or your port if modified in package.json).

Depending on how much data you have, you may need to increase the maximum heap size
for node. Run `export NODE_OPTIONS="--max-old-space-size=5120"` or similar before
starting the app it crashes.

#### Connecting to Jira

The server reads Jira configuration from a `./.env` file that defines environment variables:

```
JIRA_ROOT_URL=https://jira.somewhere.com
JIRA_USERNAME='<username>'
JIRA_PASSWORD='<password>'
```

Note that `.env` is in the `.gitignore` and will not be committed. See the `.env.sample` as a starter.

#### Assumptions

Burninator makes some assumptions about the shape of your Jira board:

- Scrum board, not Kanban
- Only sprints that were created via the board can be included
  - It turns out that sprints can be created on one board and appear in another!?!?!
  - Try not to do that
- The start date of the earliest sprint is appropriate to use for calculating the burndown
- ~~Release blocks exist in Jira as Versions~~

##### Install and Run

From the burninator directory:

```
./scripts/start.sh
```

##### Stop

```
./scripts/stop.sh
```

Unfortunately, the servers don't always exit cleanly and ports are blocked. This script will output the PIDs of the offending processes. Kill the PIDs on the far right that match the ports.

```
$ ./scripts/stop.sh
